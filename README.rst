..  note::

    If you are visiting this link after reading my article *Designing an Indoor
    Model Using OpenSCAD* in the 2021 edition of the NFFS Symposium, welcome!
    This site is an updated reference on building the *math-magik-lpp *Limited
    Pennyplane* model, with corrections to equations and figures from that
    article.

This project presents the design of a *Limited Pennyplane* indoor model airplane
using *OpenSCAD*. This is a companion to the primary project website at
https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik where analysis software for the design is
presented.

The project documentation is available at the link above. There you will find
material detailing the *OpenSCAD* code developed to support this project.

If you are interested in assisting with the development of this project, or
need help with anything found here, please contact me by email. I welcome
questions and ideas for extending this project.
