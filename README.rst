If you are visiting this link after reading my article *Designing an Indoor
Model Using OpenSCAD* in the 2021 edition of the NFFS Symposium, welcome!

This site is a work in progress. If you are interested in trying ano of this
project, please contact me at the email address above and I will be glad tro
provide assistance in getthing things running.

Here you will find updated documentation on building the *math-magik-lpp
*Limited Pennyplane* model, with corrections to equations and figures from the
symposium article.

More information on analyzing this model can be found on the companion website
at https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik

The project documentation is available at the link above. There you will find
material detailing the *OpenSCAD* code developed to support this project.

All code, both *OpenSCAD* and Python code, can be found on my github account:
