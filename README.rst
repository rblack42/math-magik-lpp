This project presents the design of a Limited Penny Plane indoor model airplane
using *OpenSCAD*. This is a companion to the primary project website at
https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik where analysis software for the design is
presented.

The project documentation is available at the link above. There you will find
material detailing thesenSCAD* code developed to support this project.

If you are interested in assisting with the development of this project, or
need help with anything found here, please contact me by email. I welcome
questions and ideas for extending this project.
