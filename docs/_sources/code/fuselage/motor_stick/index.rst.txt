MMlpp Motor Stick
#################

The motor stick is a simple piece. However, I decided to taper it at the front and rear, and add a brace for the rear hook. For those reasons, I elected to generate this piece using a 2D polygon, that gets extruded to form the final shape.

The rules limit the distance from the length of the  motor, and this gas an effect on the length of the motor stick. We will need to generate the propeller, and the prop shaft to figure out the actual motor stick length.

Here is the code containing the polygon shape.

..  literalinclude::    ../../../../scad/fuselage/motor_stick/motor_stick_data.scad
    :linenos:

And here is the code that generates the shape:

..  literalinclude::    ../../../../scad/fuselage/motor_stick/motor_stick.scad
