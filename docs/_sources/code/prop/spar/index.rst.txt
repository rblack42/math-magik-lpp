MMlpp Prop Spar
###############

The prop spar is constructed using two tapered cylinders. The standard |OSC|
*cylinder* shape has options that create this part.

The code creates a half shaft, then uses that to build the tow segments, with
one rotated into position.

Here is the code that generates this spar:

..  literalinclude::    ../../../../scad/prop/spar/spar.scad
    :linenos:
    :caption: prop/spar/spar.scad
