This short piece is a double-tapered spar. The tip side is one half the sixe of
the inner side.

..  literalinclude::    ../../../../../MMlib/double_taper_spar.scad
    :linenos:

And the code to generate this part:

..  literalinclude::    ../../../../../scad/wing/left_tip/leading_edge/leading_edge.scad
