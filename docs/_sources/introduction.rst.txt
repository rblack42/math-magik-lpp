Introduction
############

n this project, we will work through the design of a |LPP| indoor  model
airplane using |OSC|. This design will involve writing program code, something
not may model builders do when building their models, but I hope to show that
this is not too difficult, with a little help.

I will not try to teach you how to write programs for |OSC| here. Instead, we
will present the design and explain hat the code is doing. Hopefully that
description will help you see how to use this tool to generate your own
designs.

The companion website at https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik/ presents Python
code that will be used to analyze the design we present here, generating
information about the model weight and CG location.

Design Presentation
*******************

Basically, we will work through all of the parts needed to build a reasonable
|LPP| model. Along the way, we will generate a few components that are general
enough to be used in in other projects. Those components will be placed in a
library of useful parts we can use as needed. The |OSC| code for library parts
will be detailed in the :ref:`library-parts`.

If you find any of this confusing, and wish to help me clear things up so more
model builders can benefit from this, please contact me by email:
