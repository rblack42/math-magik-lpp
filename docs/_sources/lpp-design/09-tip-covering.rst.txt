Tip Covering Logic
##################

Covering the center section of the wing and stab is a snap. That covering is
actually a simple slice out of a very thin cylinder since we are using
circular arc airfoils. I chose the generate the points on a grid that covers
the center section and use the *FUnction Grapher* logic created by `Justin
lin`_ to generate the actual covering shape.

The tips are another matter. If we keep the outer ribs of the center section
vertical and raise the wing tip up to form the dihedral, the inner edge of the
tip covering is not a straight line. Mathematically, it is a piece of an ellipse
formed by cutting a cylinder with an angled plane. We can extract the
coordinates of the outer edge of the center section covering and use those points
as our starting point for the tip covering. However, we need to account for the
dihedral angle we will be using and adjust those points to find the correct
starting points for the tip covering. (Remember, there is no actual rib here.

This is not going to be too hard if we make one simple assumption.

Tip Airfoil
***********

The tip has no ribs, only the tip outline as a structure. If we cover an actual
model with this structure, something modelers typically do by building the wing
flat, then the covering assumes some shape other than out circular arc as we
move toward the tip. The actual height of this shape tapers off to zero as we
approach the tip.

Here is a basic diagram showing the tip design:

..  tikz::
    :libs: calc, intersections

    \makeatletter
    \newcommand{\gettikzxy}[3]{%
        \tikz@scan@one@point\pgfutil@firstofone#1\relax
        \edef#2{\the\pgf@x}%
        \edef#3{\the\pgf@y}%
    }
    \makeatother

    \coordinate (o) at (0,0); % name the origin
    \coordinate (le) at (5,5); % inner leading edge
    \coordinate (te) at (5,0); % inner trailing edge
    \coordinate (s) at (2,5); % start of rib arc
    \coordinate (c) at (2,3); % center of rib arc
    \coordinate (t) at (0,3);  % top of outer rib


    % draw dihedral angle
    \draw[thick] (te) -- (o) -- (t);
    \draw[thick] (s) -- (le);
    \draw[thick, name path=arc] (2,5) arc (90:180:2);
    \draw[thin] (t) --  (0,6);
    \draw[thin, name path=grid] (0,4.5) -- (5,4.5);
    \draw[thin] (t) -- (c);
    \path [name intersections={of=arc and grid, by=E}];
    \draw[black,fill] (E) circle [radius=0.05];
    \gettikzxy{(E)}{\dx}{\dy}
    \draw [thin] (E) -- (\dx,1.5);
    \draw[thin, ->] (3,5.5) -- (3,5);
    \draw[thin, ->] (3,4) node[below]{$x$} -- (3,4.5) ;
    \draw[thin, ->] (-0.25,2) -- (0,2);
    \draw[thin, <-] (\dx,2) -- (1.2,2) node [right] {$\delta$};
    \draw[thin] (2,3) -- node [left] {$r$} (E) node [above] {$p$};
    \draw [thin] (s) -- (-0.75,5);
    \draw[thin, <->] (-0.5,5) -- node [left] {$C$} (-0.5,0);
    \draw[thin] (-0.75,0) -- (0,0);

In this figure, we are going to pick points on the outer part of the tip, along
the arc and the outer tip rib, that represent the intersection of a vertical
plane parallel to the **Y** axis drawn from the inner tip rib points to the
outer tip structure. We calculate the **Y** offset of the tip at the
intersection ($\delta$ in the figure above) and draw a straight 3D line between
the inner point and this outer tip structure. We will distribute points along
this line using the number of points selected in the **Y** direction for our
grid.

We are generating the grid for our covering using evenly distributed points
along the span and chord. In that code **x**, and **y** range from zero to one
and must be scaled to determine physical values.

The equations needed for calculating the coordinates of our tip grid point
(point **p** in the figure) are given here:

..  math::

    x_p = x * C

    y_p = span - \delta

    z_p = z_t + (1 - y) * (z_r - z_t)

We can determine $\delta$ using the equation of the circular arc centered as
shown in the figure:



..  mathcode::
   import sympy

   x,r,delta,c = sympy.symbols('x r delta c')
   eq1 = (r - delta)**2 + (r - x)**2 - r**2
   sol = sympy.solve(eq1, delta)
   sol[0]

And here is an image showing the grid on the wing tip:
