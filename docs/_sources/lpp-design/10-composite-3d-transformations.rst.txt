Composite 3D Transformations
############################

In calculating the center of gravity for our model, we need to track how the center of mass for a given part moves as we align it into an assembly, them aligh an assembly into the final model. Qw uaw simple translation and rotation transformations to get our parts aligned as we wish in our design.

Translation Transformations
***************************

Mathematically, we can describe any transformaion by setting up a *transformation matcix* and using that matric to calculate the effect of a translation transformation.

Suppose we want to translate a shape using these distances in each coordinate direction: $D_x$, $D_y$, and $D_z$. If we define a point, $P$ using three positions: $x$, $y$, and $p_z$, then th e translated point can be defined using this matric multiplication:


..	math::

	T_1 = \left[\begin{matrix}1&0&0&0\\
		0&1&0&0 \\
		0&0&1&0 \\
		D_x&D_y&D_z&1\end{matrix}\right]

The position is given using a vector:

..	math;;

	P_0 = \left[\begin{matrix}P_x&P_y&P_z&1\end{matrix}\right]
