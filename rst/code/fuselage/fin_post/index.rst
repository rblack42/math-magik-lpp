MMlpp Fin Post
##############

I like making the model adjustable without resorting to bending things. For
that reason, the vertical fin will not be glued directly to the tail boom.
Instead, the leading edge will be attached, but the trailing edge will be
attached using a paper tube, allowing minor adjustments to tune the flying
circle.
